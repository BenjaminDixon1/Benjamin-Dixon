    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <br>
    <p>My interest in IT developed from my love of history, ironically enough. I wanted to make mods for a historical strategy game I enjoyed, which required learning how JSON 
        files worked. Before long I was spending hours researching the geneologies of long dead figures so that I could record their information for my mods. 
        The process of research - code 
    gave me a great deal of enjoyment as I was completing my Master's degree in Medieval Studies. I then moved on to learn Web Development, and began to create Websites
for fun, as well as to implement genuinely useful ideas. 

<br>
<br>
<br>

All of this continued as I started my Business Analyst Apprenticeship, which gave me an introduction to the IT industry. 
Through that I have learnt the Software Engineering Lifecycle,
as well as the skills of a BA.
